- `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the document type declaration for HTML5.
- `<html> </html>` we need a opening and closing html tag. This represents the root element of an html page.
- between <html> tags: 
    1. `<head> </head>` contains information about your web page i.e. a title.
    2. `<body> </body>` contains visible content in your web page.
