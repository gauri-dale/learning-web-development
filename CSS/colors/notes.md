# Colors

1. Named Colors: These are predefined keywords representing specific colors, such as red, blue, green, black, white, tomato, DodgerBlue, etc. \

2. Hexadecimal Colors (HEX): This format uses a six-digit hexadecimal number preceded by a hash symbol (#). Each pair of digits represents the red, green, and blue components of the color, respectively, ranging from 00 to FF. \
- Example : #RRGGBB \

3. RGB Colors: This format uses the rgb() function to define a color by specifying the intensity of its red, green, and blue components using integer values from 0 to 255. \
- Example : rgb(255, 0, 0) for red \

4. HSL Colors: This format uses the hsl() function to define a color based on its hue, saturation, and lightness. \
- Hue: An angle on the color wheel (0-360 degrees). \
- Saturation: The intensity of the color (0-100%). \
- Lightness: The brightness of the color (0-100%). \

- Example : hsl(hue, saturation%, lightness%)

5. HWB Colors: A newer format in CSS4 that defines colors by specifying hue, and then the amount of white and black to mix in. \
- Example : hwb(hue, whiteness%, blackness%) \
