# 3 Different Ways We Can Apply CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

1. Inline: Inline CSS refers to the method of applying CSS styles directly to a single HTML element using the style attribute within the opening tag of that element. \

2. Internal: To apply internal css, we need a pair of `<style></style>` tags in the <head>. Whatever elements that you need to apply CSS to, you'll list them in the <style> tags. \

3. External: External CSS refers to a method of applying Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to HTML documents by storing the CSS rules in a separate file with a .css extension. This external file is then linked to the HTML document(s) using the `<link>` tag within the <head> section of each HTML page that needs to utilize those styles.

- if individual elements need to be styled outside of the HTML file, you can give the element an unique `id`.
