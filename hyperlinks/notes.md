# What is a Hyperlink?
A `hyperlink` is a digital reference to data that the user can follow or be guided by clicking or tapping. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.

# To create a Hyperlink

- <a> </a>
- "a" means anchor.

# Some attributes that you can use under the anchor tag
- `href` (hypertext reference) is an attribute. An attribute is a name-value pair that modifies the behaviour of an element. Paste an URL of the website to which you want the user to be guided to.
'<a href = ""> </a>

- `target` specifies where to open the linked document or where to display the response after submitting a form. \
<hr><br>
Common values for the target attribute: \

`_self`: Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as the current page. This is the default behavior if no target is specified.\

`_blank`: Opens the linked document in a new window or tab. \

`title`: Displays initial information of the url. \

`_parent`: Opens the linked document in the parent frameset (used in conjunction with frames, which are largely deprecated in modern HTML).\

`_top`: Opens the linked document in the full body of the window, breaking out of any frames (also related to deprecated framesets).\

`framename`: Opens the linked document in a named frame (another feature related to deprecated framesets).\
